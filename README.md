## About

* on 2018-08-07 a [New attack on WPA/WPA2 using PMKID](https://hashcat.net/forum/thread-7717.html) announcment was made on the Hashcat site. The tweet linking to it:
<div align="center"><img src="img/tweet.png" alt="The announcement tweet"></div>

* using that info, and other ideas fleshed out from [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2018/08/how-to-hack-wifi-password.html) how-to post, the genesis for this project started
* on 2018-08-08 in Las Vegas, the day before [DEF CON](https://defcon.org) 26, I started building this using [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) Rolling release (4.17.0-kali1-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.17.8-1kali1 (2018-07-24) x86_64 GNU/Linux) for development and testing
* now that I'm working on it more, I see a many more posts about this method. The original how-to, [How to Hack WiFi Password Easily Using New Attack On WPA/WPA2](https://thehackernews.com/2018/08/how-to-hack-wifi-password.html), and others I'm finding, [A New Method Discovered to Crack WPA/WPA2 PSK Enabled WiFi Network Passwords](https://gbhackers.com/crack-wifi-network-passwords/), [New attack on WPA/WPA2 using PMKID](https://medium.com/@adam.toscher/new-attack-on-wpa-wpa2-using-pmkid-96c3119f7f99)

## Requirements

### Hardware

- a GNU/Linux (64 bit) based computer
- a network card that supports montior mode - see [Gotchas](#gotchas)
- a GPU (graphics processing unit) (optional, but recommended) - again, see [Gotchas](#gotchas)

### System utilities

- git
- curl
- make
- bash
- sudo (or you could run this as root :\ )

### Packages needed to build hcxtools 
  
- libopenssl and openssl-dev installed
- librt and librt-dev installed (should be installed by default)
- zlib and zlib-dev installed (for gzip compressed cap/pcap/pcapng files)
- libcurl and curl-dev installed (used by whoismac and wlancap2wpasec)
- libpthread and pthread-dev installed (used by hcxhashcattool)
       
EXAMPLE: to install all software requirements in Kali Linux: 

```apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libpcap-dev```

__TODO: include package list for other Linux distros. LMK if you figure any out!__


Centos 7:
```sudo yum install openssl-devel openssl-libs zlib zlib-devel libcurl libcurl-devel libpcap-devel```

### Tools that the script will download and build

- hcxdumptool (v4.2.0+)
- hcxtools (v4.2.0+)
- hashcat (v4.2.0+)

## Gotchas

1) You need a networking card that supports monitor mode under Linux, posts have listed the following:

```
Supported adapters (strict)

USB ID 148f:7601 Ralink Technology, Corp. MT7601U Wireless Adapter
USB ID 148f:3070 Ralink Technology, Corp. RT2870/RT3070 Wireless Adapter
USB ID 148f:5370 Ralink Technology, Corp. RT5370 Wireless Adapter
USB ID 0bda:8187 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8187 Wireless Adapter
USB ID 0bda:8189 Realtek Semiconductor Corp. RTL8187B Wireless 802.11g 54Mbps Network Adapter
```

For my development and testing, I used a [Ralink RT5370](https://www.amazon.com/Ralink-RT5370-Raspberry-adapter-function/dp/B019XUDHFC):

```
$ lsusb | grep Ralink
Bus 001 Device 039: ID 148f:5370 Ralink Technology, Corp. RT5370 Wireless Adapter
```

2) While the script can use `hashcat-legacy`, that code is over 3 years old, and relies on your CPU to crack passwords. To really get the ball rolling you can should use `hashcat` with the OpenCL headers (we pull those down as part of the build), but that requires a compatible GPU.

__TODO: give examples of how this works, with specfic drivers__

## Usage

After resolving the requirements and understanding the gotchas:

```
./wpa2own
```
